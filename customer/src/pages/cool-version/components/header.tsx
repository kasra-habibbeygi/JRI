                    Dear crypto enthusiasts, JUST READ IT: (JRI), will serve as a groundbreaking platform akin to Kickstarter. An innovative
                    NFT project that promises to redefine the landscape of crowdfunding and empower creators worldwide to bring their
                    visions to life in a decentralized and community-driven ecosystem.

                        <p>
                            Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, JRI will utilize blockchain technology to decentralize the funding
                            process. Individuals seeking funding will submit their business plans or project proposals to the JRI platform
                            using their JRI contract.
                        </p>

                        <b>Tokenized Funding Allocation</b>
                        <p>
                            Upon approval, the requested funding amount will be tokenized into a set number of NFTs, known as "project
                            puzzle pieces". Each puzzle piece represents a fraction of the total funding amount and will be available for
                            purchase by interested community members.

                            Community members will have the opportunity to purchase project puzzle pieces to support the projects they
                            believe in. By doing so, they become stakeholders in the funded projects, holding a share of the project's value
                            in their wallets.
