                        It has already commenced, and our development team is actively working on building the platform. Phase 0, which
                        focuses on distributing the NFT contracts, is essential for laying the foundation for Phase 1. Once it‚Äôs completed,
                        we will transition into Phase 1, where the blockchain-based crowdfunding platform will be fully operational,
                        expected within approximately three months.

                        How can we trust the system?

                        The system consistently proves its reliability by staying one step ahead of its promises.To establish trust in our
                        guarantees, no team member participates in NFT minting. Before minting begins, we ensure that 0.5 ETH is allocated
                        to the OGs, equivalent to the entire first day minting earnings. On the following day, we allocate the entire second
                        day minting earnings of 3 ETH to Gold Tier members for floor-sweeping purposes. Then, on the third day, for every
                        150 mints that earn 0.3 ETH, we extend an unlimited-time offer for 0.3 ETH guaranteed ŸèSpecial contracts. By the
                        time minting concludes, we've generated approximately 7 ETH in market volume through JRI guaranteed contracts alone,
                        reaffirming the system's trustworthiness and effectiveness.
